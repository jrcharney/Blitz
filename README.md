# Blitz! : LightniNG Recharged! 

So aparently things got messy.

Aparently braches were mixed up. Things were broken. Stuff exploded.

**Blitz** is a redo of LightniNG in that it fixes all those problems that made sharing the original a mess.

For oen thing, we're doing this all in VIM this time, since my environment on Linux supports using ESLint including my database.

Hopefully this time `gh-pages` will stay in its own lane.
